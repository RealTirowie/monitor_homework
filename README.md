# monitor_homework
This script checks if a new task was assigned in moodle and send email notification.

The script uses Selenium to login to the students zone, checks if new tasks compared to last time are available and sends out an email via gmail.

There are 2 versions:
1. for Windows (moodle_Win.py)
2. for Linux Server (moodle_linux.py)

variables.py
This file contains the login data of moodle and gmail for the student as well as the pages that should be tracked.
All variables can be modified and customised to specific needs.

For any question feel free to reach out to me.
